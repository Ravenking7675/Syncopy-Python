# Execute command

command_web > {UUID} > {USER ID} > {"command" : command}

##  0->OK
    1->NOT FOUND
    2->COMMAND NOT RUNNING
command_status > {UUID} > {USER ID} > {"status":0/1/2}

# THE PLAN

1) Android sends the command and python listens to the command change
2) Python processes the command 
3) Python returns a command_status code 
4) Python waits for 3 seconds and then sends the screenshot to user if status_code is OK(0)
